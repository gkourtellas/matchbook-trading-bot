"""Checks the Match Odds market for a trigger (Home or Away back odds in
range), then places the bet on the matching Double Chance runner from
the SAME event — not the Match Odds market itself.

This is a normal back bet (unlike market_lay_opponent.py), so cash-out
works on it without any special math.

Confirmed against real Matchbook data (2026-06-27):
  Double Chance runners come in this order:
    0: "<Home> or Draw"
    1: "<Home> or <Away>"
    2: "Draw or <Away>"
  Match Odds runners: 0 = Home, 1 = Away, 2 = Draw (confirmed earlier).
